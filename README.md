# CGDayPlanner
Link to deployed project: https://cgouge93.github.io/CGDayPlanner/

This is a workday planner created using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, an API for date/time, and JQuery. The app shows the current date and time slots are color-coded to reflect whether the slot is in present (red), past (grey), or future (green). The user can type in a task in a time slot and click on the save icon to save to the planner. Tasks should be stored in local storage, so they will still be on the page after reloading.
